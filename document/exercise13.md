Exercise #12: Cloud Storage Page
Create a responsive website that is similar to this site provided
Requirements:
The main content must be centered, and have a max-width of 1200px.
I used https://cssgradient.io/ to create the CSS gradient backgrounds that you see in in the nav bar, main body and section boxes.
I used the following font-awesome icons:
I used the Blinker font, from google fonts
